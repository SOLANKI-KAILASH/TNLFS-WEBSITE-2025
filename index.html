                <strong>🌸 About Us – The New Little Flower School </strong>

                Welcome to <strong>The New Little Flower School, Chandkheda, Ahmedabad </strong> — a place where children grow, learn, and
                shine.

                We are a co-educational English medium school, affiliated with the Gujarat Board (GSEB), offering
                classes from Nursery to Grade 12. Our goal is to provide a safe, happy, and inspiring environment where
                every student feels encouraged to reach their full potential.

                At our school, we believe in the power of both academics and activities. Along with strong classroom
                learning, we focus on building skills and confidence through karate, dance, sports, and other
                co-curricular activities. Our spacious school ground is used for regular games and physical training.

                We also take care of our students’ comfort and well-being. Our school has:

                Clean and separate washrooms for boys and girls

                Filtered water coolers for drinking water

                Well-lit and ventilated classrooms

                A warm and friendly team of teachers and staff


                We teach values like respect, kindness, and honesty, along with knowledge. Through celebrations, annual
                events, and cultural programs, students get the chance to express themselves and grow with joy.

                If you're looking for a school that supports your child’s all-round development — academically,
                physically, and emotionally — we welcome you to visit us and become part of The New Little Flower
                family.

               <strong> Let’s grow and bloom together! 🌼</strong>
